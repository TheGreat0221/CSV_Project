# matplotlib_csv
Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

this project is to teach students how to use CSV files in python
this project also teaches students how to visualize the data using matplotlib

## Final Changes:

csv_temps_1-4 were completed in class; we explored creating figures, pulling data, and formatting

For csv_temps_5, I pulled data from both death_valley and sitka airport dynamically and created subplots showing 
the differential between their high and low temperatures. Additionally, I created a csv_function file to handle
the data collection process and avoid excess duplicate code as much as possible.
